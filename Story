Once upon a time there was a programmer named Vincent. Vincent loved using linux and his favourite editor was VIM.
When Vincent was younger, he would use VI, but now he uses VIM- VI improved. 

Now that he's learned the tricks of VIM he starts creating a wicked program. His goal is to create a BST class!
